It is in the 'real-time web-apps' document. So, this is the suggested way of getting for example RT prices from server, and update it on the UI.
"SignalR is a software library for Microsoft ASP.NET that allows server code to send asynchronous notifications to client-side web applications."
"Listening to a specific message can be done via the on function."
"Sending a message through the WebSockets connection requires calling the send method."
