    Dear Developer. <br /><br />
Find ServeOnly1ProjectInMonorepo.cmd, customize it and run it.<br /><br />

Notes:<br />

Development of many Angular projects (Monorepo). To enjoy that any file modification reloads the browser, only 1 Angular projects should be served.  <br />
And it should be tested by visiting http://localhost:4200/ (served by that 'ng serve') and not visiting  https://localhost:5001 (which is served by the the ASP webserver)<br />
In Production, everything will be fine. Webpack files will be served by the ASP webserver as static files.<br />
