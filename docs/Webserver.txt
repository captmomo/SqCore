*** Subdomain plans when registering sqcore.net domain
like benzinga has: benzinga.com  and  pro.benzinga.com   (a different server)

> do not use www.sqcore.net  (because that will be misleading that there is 1 main site)
However, we have to use sqcore.net. Because the DNS servers will point 'sqcore.net' to somewhere.
And it is easier for the user to remember only the short 'sqcore.net', and not the longer subdomains.


>Possible subdomains of sqcore.net:
(these can be different IP address servers OR it can go to the same server inside a subfolder (the actual implementation is hidden from the user))

dashboard.sqcore.net 		// marketDashboard, we develop this now , goes to sqcore.net/MarketDashboard (but invisible)
healthmonitor.sqcore.net 	// healthmonitor, we develop this now , goes to sqcore.net/HealthMonitor (but invisible)
tools.sqcore.net			// all the simpler tools in a List: ContangoViewer, Balazs's tools. goes to sqcore.net/Tools/index.html

sqlab.sqcore.net			// route this the https://www.snifferquant.net/ webserver IP. This is Tools 2.

In the future: 

developer.sqcore.net,   	// for programmers for testing things
admin.sqcore.net,   		// for admin, not common users.
vbroker.sqcore.net, 		// the computer VBroker trading.
snifferX.sqcore.net			// for future hedge fund clients, etc.   


****************** Trust HTTPS developer certificate

https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054
ASP.NET Core
------------
Successfully installed the ASP.NET Core HTTPS Development Certificate.
To trust the certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' (Windows and macOS only).
For establishing trust on other platforms refer to the platform specific documentation.
For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054
Installing the .NET Core SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate has been installed, but it's not trusted. To trust the certificate perform the one-time step to run the dotnet dev-certs tool:
.NET Core CLI
Copy: dotnet dev-certs https --trust
"You are about to install a cert from a CA, claiming "localhost"
There is a thumbprint... ends with *....1332FEAB
This is a root certificate. If trusted, Windows will trust any other certificate issued by this CA.

After this, Chrome will accept that https://localhost is trusted.
