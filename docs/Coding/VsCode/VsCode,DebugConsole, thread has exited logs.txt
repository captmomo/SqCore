"Yes, it is "Thread Exit Messages" on VS 2015 output window. "
"Tools > Options > Debugging > General Output Settings > Thread Exit Messages : Off"
"Executing Linq queries can generate extra threads. "
Simple, easiest console.app doesn't release these. But the BenchmarkDB tool is complex, already using Nlog or opening config.json files.
Even LINQ can release threads. So, exiting threads are not a problem. Part of the framework.
Cluttering Debug console is the problem. To resolve it.

This is suggested into the launch.json:
"logging": {
                "engineLogging": false,
                "moduleLoad": false,
                "exceptions": true,
                "browserStdOut": false,
                "elapsedTiming": false,
                "programOutput": true
            },
>Agy: it works. Eliminates 'Loaded... DLL' logs from DebugConsole inside VScode.
However, Thread exit message still comes: "The thread 5032 has exited with code 0 (0x0)."
			
>Probably a better option: Always use the external terminal as console, and log into it, and ignore the internal terminal, the DebugConsole.
