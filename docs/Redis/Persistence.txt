1. Data persistance in Redis.

Config file: /etc/redis/redis.conf
2019-09-07 settings: we left the default:
it create snapshots at least every 15 minutes. So, so if a key has changed
and we want to reboot, we should wait for 15 minutes, or login and ask a "Save"
(probably better to wait at least 15 minutes and not doing any Redis insertion during that time)
Or before reboot (if you want to be sure) go to "Redis Desktop Manager" Go to "Console", type: BGSAVE, result: "Background saving started"

In the future, if you want absolute sure persistance, enable append-file type behaviour in config file. Then every INSERT will be written to disk asap.
We don't need that now.

################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################
#
# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
#   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
#
#   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
#   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
#   like in the following example:
#
#   save ""

save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check http://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

"It saved data in one of the following cases:
automatically from time to time
when you manually call BGSAVE command
when redis is shutting down
But data in redis is not really persistent, because:

crash of redis process means losing all changes since last save
BGSAVE operation can only be performed if you have enough free RAM (the amount of extra RAM is equal to the size of redis DB)"

Append-only file will be enabled by adding (or uncommenting) appendonly yes in config file
